# Laravel Availability Calendar and Booking System

Building an availability calendar and booking system can be challenging, but this application is designed to simplify the process using Laravel. It creates an appointment slot generator that considers various factors like employee schedules, time off, service duration, and existing appointments.

The system offers flexibility with multi-employee availability checks, showing all available slots for each employee. It utilizes Alpine.js to craft a user-friendly UI with a booking calendar displaying detailed availability and the ability to book appointments.
